    <h2>AMPHIBIAN</h2>
    <p>Amphibians are small vertebrates that need water, or a moist environment, to survive.
        The species in this group include frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts. All can breathe and absorb water through their very thin skin
        Amphibians also have special skin glands that produce useful proteins. Some transport water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide either into or out of the animal. Others fight bacteria or fungal infections. And at least one—in each species—is used for defense.</p>

        <p>Conraua derooi is a species of frog in the family Conrauidae. It is found in the Togo-Volta Highlands along the border of Togo and Ghana, where it is possibly endemic. The common name Togo slippery frog has been coined for this species.</p>

<h2>BIRDS</h2>
<P>Many can also run, jump, swim, and dive. Some, like penguins, have lost the ability to fly but retained their wings. Birds are found worldwide and in all habitats. The largest is the nine-foot-tall ostrich. The smallest is the two-inch-long bee hummingbird.</P>
<h3>Secretarybird</h3>

<img src=".//images/Secretarybird 3.jpeg" alt="this is Secretarybird">
<p>The secretarybird or secretary bird is a large, mostly terrestrial, bird of prey. Endemic to Africa, it is usually found in the open grasslands and savanna of the sub-Saharan region. John Frederick Miller described the species in 1779</p>

<h2>FISHES</h2>
<p>All fish share two traits: they live in water and they have a backbone—they are vertebrates.
    Apart from these similarities, however, many of the species in this group differ markedly from one another. Fin fish like salmon have gills, are covered in scales, and reproduce by laying eggs. Eels, by contrast, have worm-like bodies and exceedingly slimy skin. Lungfish gulp air. Whale sharks, the largest fish, give birth to live young and eat only tiny fish, squid, and plankton. Some species, such as the weedy sea dragon, are so bizarre they seem almost unreal.</p>
<h3>Great white shark</h3>

<p>The great white shark, also known as the white shark, white pointer, or simply great white, is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon</p>

<h2>INVERTEBRATES</h2>
<p>This is by far the largest group in the animal kingdom: 97 percent of all animals are invertebrates. So far, 1.25 million species have been described, most of which are insects, and there are millions more to be discovered. The total number of invertebrate species could be 5, 10, or even 30 million, com- pared to just 60,000 vertebrates.</p>
<h3>Camel Spider</h3>

<img src="./images/Invertebrates.jpeg" alt="this is camel spider 2">
<p>Solifugae is an order of animals in the class Arachnida known variously as camel spiders, wind scorpions, sun spiders, or solifuges. The order includes more than 1,000 described species in about 147 genera. Despite the common names, they are neither true scorpions nor true spiders.</p>

<h2>MAMMALS</h2>
<h3>Flying squirrels</h3>

<p>Flying squirrels are a tribe of 50 species of squirrels in the family Sciuridae. Despite their name, they are not in fact capable of full flight in the same way as birds or bats, but they are able to glide from one tree to another with the aid of a patagium, a furred skin membrane that stretches from wrist to ankle.</p>
